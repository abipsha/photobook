# photobook
A framework to create photobooks

# Installation
The project is partially based on other projects: Smarty as template engine and cognitom/paper-css for the css formatting of pages.

Copy all the files in your working folder.

Download Smarty from https://www.smarty.net/ and put it in <your-folder>/include/smarty/
  
cognitom/paper-css is used from the cdn, so you get it without installation, but if you prefer to have everything on your server change files accordingly.

Create a YAML file in your root (keep the extension yaml) and enjoy this piece of code.

# Configuration
In the YAML file there are all the input for the system to prepare your photobook. See the photobook.yaml file as example.
